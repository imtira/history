# GAiGAx.github.io

Currently broken on tablets, works with vert orientation on phones. I Wont fix it anytime soon, just get a better device.

Fun fact: VSCode doesn't actually push commits to the repo, it just stages and commits. Worked that out after Git kept saying that no changes were made 
when i tried 'git commit', but typing 'git push' *does* push to the repo, and says the files were staged minutes ago using the VSCode commit message.
